  "markdown": "This report outlines the top root causes affecting the KPI 'value_speed' based on statistical analysis. The analysis includes correlation coefficients and p-values to assess the strength and significance of the relationships. Additionally, outliers identified in the dataset are highlighted to provide context for the findings. Understanding these relationships is crucial for strategic decision-making at the executive level, as they directly impact operational efficiency and performance metrics. Based on the statistical data, the following hypotheses are proposed: 1. Increasing 'value_pressure' leads to enhanced 'value_speed' due to improved operational conditions. 2. High 'value_temperature' negatively impacts 'value_speed' by causing inefficiencies in the system. 3. The presence of outliers in 'value_pressure' and 'value_temperature' indicates that extreme values may disrupt normal operational performance, suggesting a need for monitoring and control mechanisms.",
